# pagu-box

A cross-platform sandboxed launcher for coding agents (Claude Code, opencode,
aider, codex CLI, …). Wraps the agent in a hardened process boundary that hides
secrets and limits filesystem reach without breaking ergonomics.

Sibling of [pagu] — the hermit-crab agent that the model cannot exec from.
pagu-box is **the shell without the crab**: bring your own agent.

| | pagu | pagu-box |
|-|------|----------|
| Trust model | Model can't exec — capability ladder + human gate | Process boundary — sandbox + secret hiding |
| Default policy | Deny | Allow (minus a secret deny-list) |
| Agent | Custom Deno runtime | Any third-party CLI agent |
| Use when | High-trust commands, irreversible actions | Day-to-day coding with an existing agent |

## Threat model

**Defends against:** a prompt-injected or compromised agent that tries to read
your SSH keys, GPG keys, browser cookies, password store, shell history, or
cloud credentials and exfiltrate them via API calls. The agent finds an empty
directory or `/dev/null` where the secret should be.

**Does NOT defend against:**

- Side-channels (network traffic analysis, timing).
- User-confirmed destructive actions — if you approve `rm -rf ~/project`, that's
  on you. pagu-box constrains what the agent can _reach_, not what you let it
  _do_ inside that reach.
- Kernel exploits in the sandbox primitives themselves (bwrap, sandbox-exec).

## What's hidden by default

| Path | Why |
|------|-----|
| `~/.ssh` | git push / server access |
| `~/.gnupg` | commit signing, file decryption |
| `~/.aws` | cloud credentials |
| `~/.azure`, `~/.config/gcloud` | cloud credentials |
| `~/.config/sops`, `~/.config/age` | secret-decryption keys |
| `~/.config/gh`, `~/.config/op` | GitHub / 1Password CLI tokens |
| `~/.password-store` | pass(1) |
| `~/.netrc` | git, curl credentials |
| `~/.bash_history`, `~/.zsh_history`, `~/.python_history` | command history |
| macOS: `~/Library/Keychains` | macOS keychain |
| macOS: `~/Library/{Cookies,Mail,Messages,Safari}` | browser / mail / messages |
| macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/{1Password,Bitwarden}` | password managers |
| Linux: `/etc/ssh`, `/etc/shadow` | host keys (sops master if reused), shadow |

What's **allowed** beyond that: full `$HOME` read/write, network, and standard
system paths. The agent can read your shell config, editor config, tool
configs — anything that isn't credential-bearing.

## Install

Flake input:

```nix
inputs.pagu-box.url = "github:phibkro/pagu-box";
```

home-manager:

```nix
imports = [ inputs.pagu-box.homeManagerModules.default ];
programs.pagu-box.enable = true;
```

The `pagu-box` binary appears on PATH; `pagu-box claude` launches Claude Code
under the sandbox.

## Use

```sh
pagu-box claude               # default policy
pagu-box --no-net claude      # additionally drop network
pagu-box --allow /mnt/data claude         # extra RW bind
pagu-box --deny ~/.npmrc claude           # extra secret to hide
pagu-box --env FOO=bar claude             # pass an env var through the scrub
```

The default env scrub forwards `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `HOME`, `USER`, `PATH`,
`TERM`, `LANG`, plus the cert-bundle locations. Everything else is dropped.
Pass agent-specific env vars with `--env`.

## Mechanism

| | Linux | macOS |
|---|-------|-------|
| Sandbox primitive | `bubblewrap` (user namespaces) | `sandbox-exec` (seatbelt LSM) |
| Network drop | `--unshare-net` | `(deny network*)` |
| FS hide (dirs) | `--tmpfs` overlay | `(deny file-read* file-write* (subpath …))` |
| FS hide (files) | `--bind /dev/null` | `(deny file-read* file-write* (literal …))` |

The two mechanisms enforce the same policy; the underlying kernel layer is
different. Linux uses user-namespace isolation (no setuid, no kernel privileges
required). macOS uses Apple's seatbelt — officially "deprecated" since ~2018
but still actively used by Apple in their own browser sandboxing on macOS 15
(Sequoia) and there's no announced replacement.

## Status

v1 — minimum viable. Linux + macOS, allowlist via flags, deny-list compiled in
+ extendable. No telemetry, no audit log, no secret injection (yet).

Future surface, in roughly that order of likely arrival:

1. Configurable home-manager-module options mirroring the CLI flags.
2. Audit mode — log what files the agent _actually_ touched (eBPF / dtrace).
3. Secret injection — read secrets from sops/Bitwarden at invocation, inject
   into env, never persist on the agent's filesystem.
4. Per-project profile files (`.pagu-box.toml` in repo root → policy override).
